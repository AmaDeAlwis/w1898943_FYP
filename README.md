Breast cancer survival probability prediction model


Project overview

This project focuses on predicting survival probabilities for breast cancer patients using machine learning, statistical models and deep learning models. The study utilizes the METABRIC dataset, which includes treatment types and gene expression data.

Models used

The following models were implemented partially to predict survival probabilities.

XGBoost,
Coxpropotional hazard model,
Aalen's additive hazard model and
Graph neural network (GNN)


These models can be changed in future since the model establishments are ongoing.

Methodology

Exploratory Data Analysis,
Data pre processing,
Model training.


Next steps - Cross validation,
             Hyperparamter tuning,
             Model evaluation using appropriate performance metrics and
             building a user friendly interface to input clinical data for patients to get probability predictions.


User Interface

A streamlit based user interface will be developed.

Repository information

This does not include the full code of the prediction model (in progress).
The code was developed and executed through Google Colab.
