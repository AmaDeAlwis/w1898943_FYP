Breast cancer survival probability prediction model


Project overview

This project focuses on predicting survival probabilities for breast cancer patients using machine learning and deep learning models. The study utilizes the METABRIC dataset, which includes treatment types and specifies whether a patient died from the disease or another cause. The predictions aim to provide patients with survival probabilities.

Models used
The following models were implemented partially to predict survival probabilities

XGBoost
Coxpropotional hazard model
Aalen's additive hazard model
Graph neural network (GNN)
These models can be changed in future since the model establishments are ongoing

Methodology

Exploratory Data Analysis
Data pre processing
Model training
Next steps - Cross validation
             Hyperparamter tuning
             Model evaluation using appropriate performance metrics
             Building a user friendly interface to input clinical data for patients to get probability predictions


User Interface
A streamlit based user interface will be developed.

Repository information
This does not include the full code of the prediction model (in progress).
The code was developed and executed through Google Colab.
